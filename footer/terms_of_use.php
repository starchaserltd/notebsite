	By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for the actions, information or omissions of a laptop model, laptop retailer, laptop producer, laptop brand or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular laptop model, laptop retailer, laptop producer, laptop brand or other third parties who caused you harm.
