<tr><td><b>Description:</b></td><td width="800px;">Noteb.com has a propriety crawler to scrape the internet for laptop prices. However, the crawler currently works with most of its values predefined, ex.: the list of pages it has to read, what to select from each of them and what to do with the information. We want to make the crawler more dynamic, in a sense, that it works like a service, which receives the URL it has to read plus some other parameters like the CSS selectors and rules on what to return depending on what it finds with those selectors.</td></tr>
